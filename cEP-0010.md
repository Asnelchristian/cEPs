Abstract
--------

This cEP describes the design of coala's Command Line Interface (the action selection screen). It intended to refactor the designed released as part of coala 0.8.

Adds functionality alongside with a better interaction with the user. The final goal is coala CLI to be more friendly, easier to read and use, more functionality depending on what user wants!

Changes
-------

The following changes shall be made to the CLI:

1. Remove most of the text from the action selection screen
2. Use letters instead of numbers for selecting actions
3. Allow chaining actions in a single input
4. Add a 'selection action for all results' option
5. Make ApplyPatchAction log the applied patch
6. Reprompt after running actions only if the action says so
7. Set 'Do nothing' as the default action

The below section describes why we should make these changes.

Why
---

### Remove most of the text from the action selection screen

Most of the people who use a CLI program do not read the whole output, only a small part of it. Also, a large output from a command could tire them and could make them stop using our product We want to remove the redundant information, keeping only the necessary information.

### Use letters instead of numbers for selecting actions

Easier to remember an action based on the letters instead of numbers. (Do (n)othing).

### Allow chaining actions in a single input

Users could apply more than one patch in a single input. The idea here is to offer more flexibility to our users. Instead of just 1 number, the user could enter an array of choices.

### Add a 'selection action for all results' option

Now users have the possibility to choose at every result an action. We want to add the possibility to choose an action at every result.

### Reprompt after running actions

We should have an option that lets user choose whether they want another action after the current action is done. This way, users will have the flexibility in their hands.

### Set 'Do nothing' as the default action

If a user chooses a non-existent action (or the input is wrong) just exit from the program with 'Do nothing'. This is for reuse of 'Do nothing'.

The below section describe how we should make these changes.
